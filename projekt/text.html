Numerous ad campaigns give the impression that these are the only two choices out there for anyone looking to buy a computer. But there's a small group of rebels out there who know better. Their OS of choice is Linux and they back a very different philosophy than the one followed by the big companies. <br/>

                            Linux is an open-source operating system. To really understand what that means, we need to define some terms. An operating system is a layer of software on a computer that acts as a foundation for computer programs. It's the OS's job to monitor computer resources and allocate those resources to programs that need them. When you execute a program, the OS acts like a supervisor and makes sure the program has the processing power, memory and any other resources it might need to function. Operating systems make it easy for program developers to write software -- without an OS, the programmer would have to create software to work directly from the hardware itself. <br/>

                            That covers what an operating system is, but what about open source? Operating systems like Windows and Mac OS X are compiled. They`re easy for machines to understand. But compiled code is difficult for humans to understand -- it's extremely complex. That means it`s not easy for the average user to see how Microsoft or Apple put their operating systems together. <br/>

Machines can`t understand source code, which is why developers feed the source code through a compiler. <br/>

                            Because Linux includes the source code for the operating system, you can see how the OS works just by downloading it. You`ll have to understand programming languages but there`s no level of secrecy with what makes Linux tick. The benefit of this approach is that many Linux users are also the developers for the OS. If a user sees a bug or vulnerability, he or she can whip up some code to fix the problem and contribute to the next version of Linux. The same is true for features -- if you think of a cool function that you believe Linux should support, you can build it into the source code. <br/>

                            Ubuntu is a distribution -- or distro -- of Linux. In Linux lingo, a distribution is a version of the operating system that has the Linux kernel as its foundation. There are literally hundreds of different Linux distros out in the wild. Many are free and have communities of users who provide each other with guidance and support. But installing a free Linux distro with limited support options can be intimidating to the average computer user. That`s where Ubuntu comes in. <br/>

                            Ubuntu, distributed by a company named Canonical, is an example of a commercial project based on the Linux kernel. Founded by businessman and philanthropist Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical`s mission is to provide a software platform that is free for users and developers. Rather than charge for the operating system, Canonical`s business depends upon providing commercial support for its products. It also helps companies and organizations design computer systems with an eye on efficiency and cost management. <br/>
